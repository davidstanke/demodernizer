# demodernizer
An agentic tool for creating "legacy" applications -- software using old technologies and full of tech debt.

The generated applications are intended for use in demos showing modernization projects [e.g. using agentic coding tools]. To make them easy to run in a local environment, the tech stacks specify local database options (e.g. SQLite or in-memory options)

See `GEMINI.md` and the skills in `.gemini/skills` for more details.

## Setting up
- `npm install -g playwright`
- `npx playwright install`
